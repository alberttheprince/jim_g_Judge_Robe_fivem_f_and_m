FiveM-ready female and male add-ons, so at the end of clothing numbers.

[ Disclaimer ] 
I did not make the male judge robe. I can't remember where it's from, but it was a free release. 
I just modified the female version a bit in Blender to fit a female body better.

The only reason I've done this is because some people are selling the same one that was given free [only male version]. I think it's in AP-Courts Discord somewhere.

So I just made a female version and added it to a clothing pack for free.
